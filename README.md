# Compresser

This program takes in an image and compresses it in the same extension. Using Single value decomposition and the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm, this program is able to reduce the final size in a few seconds.

#### Inputs

The inputs to this program are a `file directory` (absolute or relative path), and a `decomposition percentage` which is basically how high you want the resolution to be.
