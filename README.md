# LinearPress

This program takes in an image and compresses it in the same extension. Using Single Value Decomposition(SVD) and the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm, this program is able to reduce the final size in a few seconds.

#### Inputs

The inputs to this program are a `file directory` (absolute or relative path), and a `decomposition percentage`(DP) which is basically how high you want the resolution to be.

#### Samples

<img src="images/rgb.png" width=300 align=right>

| DP  |         Image          |
| :-: | :--------------------: |
|  1  |  ![](images/rgb1.png)  |
|  5  |  ![](images/rgb5.png)  |
| 10  | ![](images/rgb10.png)  |
| 25  | ![](images/rgb25.png)  |
| 50  | ![](images/rgb50.png)  |
| 100 | ![](images/rgb100.png) |
